# GawkCam

A friendly interface for [Aiza](https://github.com/tvillega/Aiza) to watch IP Cameras on Linux.

### To-do

I'm creating this from scratch, so I need to start small.

* Add UI button.
* Trigger `on_mpv()` with button.
* Hardcode buttons to different videos.
* Read video URLs from config file.
